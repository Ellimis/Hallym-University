-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Professor Keith Robinson

 My name is Min-seok Kim, and I am a student in CE4 (04).
I would like to apologize for the absent in your class.
I enjoyed the class every time, and I like to study English.
But I got a sick at last Friday, so I could not go to class and I forgot to let you know. 
If I also get sick next time, I will ask for your understanding or leave a mail. 
I hope you don't take a bad view of me because of this happen. 
Additional, could you please let me know if there was any announcement you said in class?

Thank you for teaching English hard for the students. 
See you next class.

Best regards,

Kim Min-seok
