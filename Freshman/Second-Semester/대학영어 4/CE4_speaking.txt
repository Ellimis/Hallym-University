Subject : A personal statement

Last semester, as a team leader of the game development project, I directed the specific programming to the team members and took charge of the overall development.

Before project began, i studied programming language associated in project development and charted the work progress more easier to see.
It gave me very broad knowledge for game development, and showed the direction of the team proejct.

When team project just started, I saw my team memberdks wandering about, not knowing what to start with.
But after I explained the whole detail about the game with chart, the game development began to pick up speed.

Thanks to the beforehand project knowledge, I have been very helpful to the team and in developing other games with such a various knowledge until now.
Through this game development project, i could learn how to instruct team members and what to do for teamwork.

So my current aim is to enter the large game corporation, further utilize my leadership skill and more increase my understanding about game development.

Subject : A personal experience

what i want to talk is participating in the singing contest

When I was in the second grade of high school, 10 of my classmates and I applied to the singing contest.
The singing contest could be applied alone or with two or three person.
I was only going to look around, but my best friend suggested me to go out as a two person group, so I participated.
However, while preparing for the singing contest, I wanted to give up because I was embarrassed and worried that I might fail.
But also I wanted to change my mind and to make a memory as a high school student, so I did it all the way.
The singing contest was pretty good with the third place overall. 
Through this contest, I didn't give up or try to run away from anything that happened afterwards.

Originally, I was so shy that I couldn't even make a presentation like this.
Thanks to my best friend, I can do anything with confidence

Subject : A future ambition

My future ambition is to make a lot of money and travel abroad alone.
I have two reason why i chosen this ambition.

First, many people said that they are not happy even if they have a lot of money.
But i think having a lot of money doesn't make our life unhappy at least.
So I want to make as much money as possible.
That makes me experience what I want to do.

Second, I like to see the scenery which is interesting or not easily accessible in everyday life.
When I get into a public transportation or a car, I move to destination while looking at the surrounding scenery.
And also my laptop background screen is Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia that is the world's largest salt flat where the sky and the earth are reflected each other by the standard horizon.
I really want to go there.

Thank you for hear my future ambition.
